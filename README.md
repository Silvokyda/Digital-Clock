# Digital-Clock

This code will create a Tkinter window with a label displaying the current time. The time is updated every second by calling the update_time function, which uses the time module to get the current time and updates the label text with the formatted time string.

To run this code, save it to a file (e.g., clock.py) and run it with Python:

```
python clock.py

```

This will open a window with the digital clock running. You can stop the clock by closing the window or pressing CTRL+C in the terminal.
